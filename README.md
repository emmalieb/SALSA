# SALSA - Solar Applied pLanetary dataSet cAlibration
Python tool for using solar data from NASA's Solar Radiation & Climate Experiment (SORCE) to calibrate planetary datasets.

## Objectives
* The tool is as universal as it can be - a user inputs a planetary dataset of any planetary body in our solar system at a given time, and based on the solar activity at the positon of the body, it will return a calibrated dataset for that object.

* It is also capable of producing measurable attributes such as reflectivity and atmospheric or surface composition also based on the solar activity for the time specified by the user.
